				<h1>India</h1>
				<p>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a
					kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved
					all-round socio-economic progress during the last 64 years of its
					Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural
					production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in
					the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space
					to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area
					of 32,87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan
					heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th
					largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of
					Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the
					country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great
					Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic
					of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of
					Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.</p>
				<p>Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland
					extends between latitudes 8° 4' and 37° 6' north, longitudes 68° 7'
					and 97° 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south
					between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west
					between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about
					15,200 km. The total length of the coastline of the mainland,
					Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman & Nicobar Islands is 7,516.6 km.</p>
